# Neural Network Optimization Library
This is a simple neural network library that allow to build and train standard neural network.

##Â Optimization analysis

We also provide a discusion and comparison on two different optimizer used to fit neural network:
- Cholesky alghotihm
- Adam optimizer, we provide a discussion about its convergence by summarising the several papers disussing this topic.
The analysis can be found in the [CM_report.pdf](Reports/CM_report.pdf).

#### Other info

Libraries in requirements file are not needed to run our scratch implementation. They are used just to compare our results.

Note: this project was implemented for the Machine Learning course and Computational Mathematic course 2020.
