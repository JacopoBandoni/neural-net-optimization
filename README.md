# ML_CM - project
This is the main root of the Computational Mathematics course where we did project (17) where aim is to test and implement a direct method (Cholesky) and a iterative method (Adam).


* ./guides_and_tips: folder where are stored all references from papers, tips from professor and useful resources found online
* ./Sources: folder where are store all .py codes. It is present the general Neural Network class used as general framework to build either an Extreme Learning Machine or a Deep Feed Forward Neural network. 
The folder is splitted into: 
	* ./Source/tools: there are all usefull methods to load, initialize and evaluate our algorithms.
	* ./Source/solver: there are our algorithm implementation 

Libraries in requirements file are not needed to run our scratch implementation. They are inserted just for when we use them to compare our results. 

To run an experiment you can execute the corresponding file starting with CM, inserting in the code the parameters of the model.
